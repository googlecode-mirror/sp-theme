# Introduction #

Lineage: _Scribbish_ (for Typo) -> _Simplish_ (for Wordpress) -> _Sp_ (for Habari)

# Details #
Few if any lines of CSS have survived from J.A. Hardy's original (MIT-licensed) [Scribbish](http://quotedprintable.com/pages/scribbish), but its page design is admired and directly imitated in Sp. Sp doesn't share any PHP source with the non-Habari themes above, but frequently exchanges ideas, methods, and contributors with Simplish.

## Numbers ##
Sp versioning started sensibly enough, roughly tracking the compatible Habari in a traditional three-part (x.y.z) form. Now a coarser single-digit "edition" is used. The edition number increments when sp's appearance changes.

From its initial release in October 2008, sp has carried the numbers: 1, then a series labeled 0.6.`[`1-3`]`, succeeded by editions 6 through 9. The errant "10th" and "13th" were private or dead-end branches and did not see outside release. The current edition is numbered 14.

### Edition? ###
It's not exactly a version number. There will be several non-cosmetic changes within any edition's lifetime, without causing the number to increment. We drifted into this scheme less as an homage than to experiment with a way of numbering that emphasizes those changes most interesting to most users of a blog template "theme": changes in the appearance presented to visitors.

#### Never expected to live this long... ####

The more currently pertinent defense is that we expected the _n_ in _nth Edition_ to stay tiny; a project originally dedicated to reproducing the looks of a theme last updated in 2006 wasn't supposed to change that much. However, properties of the theme, and chiefly of the underlying Habari engine, have made it a nice place for incremental experiments - sometimes even experiments as boring as the crazy versioning scheme.

### Historically Trivial ###
#### v6 Discontinued ####
The [6th edition](http://code.google.com/p/sp-theme/downloads/detail?name=sp6.tgz) worked atop the 0.6.x Habari releases. First branched in January 2009 and more or less "current" for official Habari releases for over 2 years, spv6 is no longer maintained, tested or otherwise handled. The deprecated snapshot available in the Downloads area was created 2009-04-18.

#### Old Changelog ####
The Sp changelog 2008-11-18 through 2009-11-22 was not migrated from the utopian labs git server during the move to this site.
